## First Streamlit Project
### Flower-Classifier

In a [previous project](https://github.com/Sabacon/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Iris%20with%20KNN.ipynb), I built a model with the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm that classifies flowers using data from the Iris dataset.
I've built an [app with Streamlit](https://sabacon-flower-classifier-flower-classifier-1yioji.streamlit.app/) to do the exact same thing.
